The problem is as follows: 

A blacksmith gave his apprentice a task, ordering them to make a selection of rings. 
The apprentice is not yet skilled in the craft and as a result of this, 
some (to be honest, most) of rings came out connected together. 
Now heâ€™s asking for your help separating the rings and deciding how to break enough rings free 
so as to get the maximum number of rings possible. All of the rings are numbered and you are told 
which of the rings are connected. This information is given as a sequence of sets. 
Each set describes the connected rings. For example: {1, 2} means that the 1st and 2nd rings are connected. 
You should count how many rings we need to break to get the maximum of separate rings. 
Each of the rings are numbered in a range from 1 to N, where N is total quantity of rings.
